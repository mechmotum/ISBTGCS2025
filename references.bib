  abstract = {Musculoskeletal simulations of movement can provide insights needed to help humans regain mobility after injuries and design robots that interact with humans. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation but requires extensive technical expertise to implement. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves, allowing them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle the wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyographydriven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which are common in musculoskeletal models. To show Moco's abilities, we first solve for muscle activity that produces an observed walking motion while minimizing muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Then, we predict a squat-to-stand motion and optimize the stiffness of a passive assistive knee device. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand human and animal movement.},
